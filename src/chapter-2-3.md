Assessing Your Personal Approach to Change
======================================================================

Change is an inevitable part of organizational life, and as a change management professional, it is essential to understand your personal approach to change. In this chapter, we will explore different approaches to change and provide a self-assessment tool to help you identify your preferred approach.

Approaches to Change
--------------------

There are several different approaches to change that individuals may adopt:

### 1. Conservator

Conservators prefer stability and continuity over change. They may resist change and prefer to maintain the status quo.

### 2. Pragmatist

Pragmatists are open to change but prefer practical solutions that are based on evidence and data. They may be skeptical of change that is not supported by evidence.

### 3. Innovator

Innovators embrace change and are willing to take risks to achieve new outcomes. They may be early adopters of new ideas and technologies.
